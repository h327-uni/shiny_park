Auckland Domain,"Pukekawa / Auckland Domain is our oldest park and one of the largest. Developed on 75 hectares around the cone of an extinct volcano. The 'tuff rings' created by volcanic activity can be seen in the land contours and forms a natural amphitheatre.
Pukekawa / Auckland Domain is the remnant of the ancient volcano Pukekawa. Its crater extends around the outside of the sport fields. The small volcanic hill is Pukekaroa, the site of a pa inhabited and fought over by many different iwi (tribes) throughout the early history of Tamaki Makaurau.
Governor Robert Fitzroy set aside the 75ha park in 1843, and since then it has gone through many changes.
During the Second World War it was used as a campground by American troops, and many exotic plants and birds were introduced by the Acclimatisation Society.
During the 1920s, the Wintergarden added Art Deco style and the Auckland War Memorial Museum became a permanent memorial to our fallen service men and women.
The Domain Wintergarden was designed by Auckland architect William Gummer in the early 1900s and are a complex of gardens located within the Pukekawa / Auckland Domain. The glasshouses have recently been reopened after two years of seismic strengthening and restoration.
Still present in the domain is a mighty tōtara tree, which represents the continued peace agreement between the Waikato tribes of Te Wherowhero, Ngāti Whātua and Ngāpuhi.",https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/parks-recreation/find-park-beach/park-detail/126.html,75.9
Onepoto Domain,"Onepoto Domain is a large park, located at the base of Onewa Road, alongside the Northern Motorway. The crater-shaped domain was formed by an eruption 20,000 to 30,000 years ago.
The domain is perfect for a variety of sports activities for all ages, and can host large numbers of visitors. The wide paths and boardwalks throughout the park are good for walking, push chairs and wheelchairs.
There are two small freshwater lakes within the domain so keep an eye on small children!
Car access from Tarahanga Street. Pedestrian access also from Puawai Place, Sylvian Avenue and Exmouth Road.
A playground, toilets and changing rooms, seating and picnic tables, large car park (including mobility parks), drinking fountains, bike stands, and barbecues are inside the park.
The concrete paths around the lake are flat and even. The bridge is sloped and slightly uneven so you need to take care when using this. The board walk behind the playground is not wheelchair accessible as there is a 6cm step at the entrance.",https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/parks-recreation/find-park-beach/park-detail/424.html,33.6
